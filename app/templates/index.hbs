          <p class="lead">Our goal is to bring some of the most enthusiastic and motivated students from Trinity College together under the one roof to actively address this idea. We’re looking for students from <strong>all disciplines</strong>. If you like the idea of using technology to provoke <strong>positive social change</strong>, we want you! Interested in social entrepreneurship? We want you! We're looking for change makers, that doesn't mean you have to have a background in technology by any means.</p>
          <p class="lead">The cohort will be split into teams comprising of roughly one technologist to two students from other disciplines. Throughout the day, these teams will develop a <strong>new solution</strong> which induces some kind of positive social change through the use of new technologies, and specifically, software development.</p>
          <p class="lead">As well as meeting like minded, innovative change makers, you will get to hear some inspiring people speak about social innovation and technology for development in our <strong>speaker series</strong> in the morning.</p>
          <p class="lead">The theme for this Dev, meet Tech event is <strong>food</strong> so we'll be tackling global issues associated with food.</p>

                What is Dev, meet Tech?
              </h4>
              <p class="lead">
                Dev, meet Tech is an event for students addressing ways to use technology for positive development. About one third of the attendees will be from a technical background. The rest will be from a range of <strong>different disciplines</strong> with a range of <strong>different skillsets</strong> and outlooks on life. The one thing all attendees will have in common is their drive to be global citizens and in some way improve today’s world. After our speaker series in the morning, the cohort will be split into teams and spend the rest of the day <strong>developing a solution which uses technology</strong> to provoke a positive change of any size and any kind. We have some fantastic mentors to help guide the teams and an atmosphere of collaboration will be encouraged.
